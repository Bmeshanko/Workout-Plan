# Workout-Plan

This project will be done in two phases.

# Phase 1

Compile generators and calculators of different workouts to determine how to build up muscular strength and endurance, as well as cardiovascular endurance in an optimal way. Several workouts that will be indexed:
- Running (Treadmill)
- Bench Press + Incline Bench Press
- Squat + Lunge
- Deadlift
- Misc. Non-Compound Machines

This will give a baseline of what I should be lifting and how I should be building up and adding weight to the One-rep max input of the calculator.

# Phase 2

Bring these generators together to form a weekly plan. Currently, an 8 day workout cycle could go as follows:

- Chest, Triceps, Shoulders
- Back, Biceps
- Legs
- Cardio
- Chest, Triceps, Shoulders
- Back, Biceps
- Legs
- REST

Using this program, I can use File I/O to store my lifting records in order to recommend what weights to try for the next week.
